# HoriseonSEO
##  Horiseon SEO & Marketing Website
Horiseon SEO wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards, so that their own website would be optimized for search engines.

### What was your motivation?
- My motivation for this project was to gain a better understanding of accessibility standards and sementic elements.

### Why did you build this project?
- After looking at the original code I could see there were no semantic elements being used, which made it very hard to understand and read. 

### What problem does it solve?
- Added semantic elements instead of using <div> tags allows accessibility and readability. Doing this allows future developers to easily understand what is happening. 

### What did you learn?
- I learned proper placement for sementic elements. I learned about using different types of selectors
