# HoriseonSEO
##  Horiseon SEO & Marketing Website
Horiseon SEO wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards, so that their own website would be optimized for search engines.
- What was your motivation?
```
My motivation for this project was to gain a better understanding of accessibility standards and sementic elements.
```
- Why did you build this project?
```
After looking at the original code I could see there were no semantic elements being used, which made it very hard to understand and read. 
```
- What problem does it solve?
```
Added semantic elements instead of using <div> tags allows accessibility and readability. Doing this allows future developers to easily understand what is happening. 
```
- What did you learn?
```
I learned proper placement for sementic elements. I learned about using different types of selectors
